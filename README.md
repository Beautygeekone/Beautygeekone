I'm a former English teacher who somehow ended up writing code instead of essays. Iâ€™m studying Full Stack at UTN Buenos Aires and building stuff that ideally works. I pick things up quickly, get (really) obsessed, and tend to figure things out one way or another. Most days, Iâ€™m either fixing bugs or pretending they donâ€™t exist. Outside of code, I overthink things like how technology and psychology intersect (?). Good code, like good writing, should say just enough and know when to shut up.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vite, JavaScript and React.
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
(And more!)

Fun fact: I debug code with the same patience I use to explain Passive Voice to my students. The best part? The code never asks "Why?"
